        <h2>TIGER</h2>
        <p> Tiger is the national animal of our country.
            The tiger is the largest member of the cat family and one of the most powerful predators in the animal kingdom.
            Known for its striking orange coat with black stripes, the tiger is a symbol of strength and courage in many cultures.
            Tigers are solitary and territorial animals, found mainly in parts of Asia including India, Russia, and Southeast Asia. They are carnivores, feeding on deer, wild boar, and other large mammals. Tigers are also excellent swimmers, unlike many other big cats. Sadly, all tiger subspecies are either endangered or critically endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these magnificent animals and ensure their survival for future generations.

            <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large, powerful cat known for its muscular build, short head, and distinctive mane (in males).
                They are typically yellow-brown in color and live in social groups called prides.
